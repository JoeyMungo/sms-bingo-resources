# Where Help Is Needed Most
- Documenting coins for all worlds. I've been copying the names from the [Bingo Resources Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b8QYMr8DeSAtjjIhWHQ0JRY52W-bqknXQ1iyfqEzMiQ/edit#gid=137137649)
- 100s routes for all worlds. The more variations we have the better, video and/or images strongly preferred.
- Blue routes and variations with videos. Try to avoid IL specific stuff.
- Videos of how to do special shines like hoverless.
